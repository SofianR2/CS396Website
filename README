Accessibility Features:
I added an accessibility menu that lets users adjust both
the font size and family. When the user clicks the button
with the gear icon, a smalll pop up appears that allows
for adjusting the font size (small, medium, large, extra large), 
and the font family (Arial, Helvetica, Georgia, Verdana, Tahoma).

Additionally, there is a reset button at the bottom of the popup
menu that restores the default font size and family (medium and arial).

The pop up menu should be accessible by keyoard by tabbing to it, and 
can be opened by pressing enter, and closed by pressing escape.
