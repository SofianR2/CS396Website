						In a night that will forever be etched in Tottenham Hotspur's illustrious history, the Lilywhites secured their fourth European trophy with a dramatic 1-0 victory over Manchester United in the 2025 Europa League Final in Bilbao. The triumph marked a triumphant return to European glory for Spurs, who had last tasted continental success in 1984.
					</p>	
					<p>
						The match began with both sides showing respect for each other's attacking prowess, but it was Tottenham who struck first through their top-scorer Brennan Johnson. In the 42nd minute, a perfectly weighted pass from Pape Matar Sarr found Brennan Johnson breaking through United's defensive line, and the Welsh international coolly slotted the ball past the scrambling goalkeeper to send the traveling Spurs faithful into raptures.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second half was a tense affair, with both teams creating chances but failing to convert.
						But in the 69th minute, Micky Van de Ven became the hero of the night. After an error by goakeeper Vicario, Alejandro Garnacho's goal-bound header seemed to spell doom for the Lillywhites. However, Micky Van de Ven was a step ahead, showcasing incredible acrobatics to clear the ball off the line.
						The final whistle later confirmed Tottenham's return to the pinnacle of European football.
