				<h2>Club Origin</h2>
				<p>
					Tottenham Hotspur Football Club was founded in 1882 by a group of schoolboys from the Hotspur Cricket Club, who were looking for a winter sport to keep them active during the cricket off-season. The club was originally named "Hotspur Football Club" after the famous Shakespearean character Sir Henry Percy, known as "Harry Hotspur," who was renowned for his speed and fighting spirit. The name perfectly captured the club's early philosophy of playing with pace, flair, and attacking football. In 1884, the club was renamed "Tottenham Hotspur Football Club" to distinguish it from another London club, and the iconic "Spurs" nickname was born. The club's early years were spent playing on various grounds around North London, including Tottenham Marshes, before settling at Northumberland Park in 1888. It wasn't until 1899 that Tottenham moved to their legendary home, White Hart Lane, which would become the spiritual heart of the club for over 118 years. The club's distinctive white shirts and navy blue shorts were adopted in 1883, creating the iconic "Lilywhites" identity that has become synonymous with Tottenham Hotspur around the world. From these humble beginnings in a North London schoolyard, Tottenham Hotspur has grown into one of England's most storied football clubs, carrying forward the spirit of "To Dare is to Do" that was instilled in those early days.
